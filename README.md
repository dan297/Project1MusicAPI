# Description

This project has been developed as a group project, MusicsearchAPI is a user friendly webpage enabling user to find their favorite songs and artist details.

How it works?

This webpage works 2 ways, you can search the artist's name and you will get a list of songs or remix sung by that certain artist.

Second function allows the user to get artist's picture by searching the song name.

User can clear their search history by using the buttons enabled for both sections.
